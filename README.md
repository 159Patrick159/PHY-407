# PHY-407 | Computational Physics
This repository contains the python prgrams for all the labs of PHY407 during the fall 2022 semester. Each sub-directory holds all the work done for a specific lab, where every question has its corresponding python script. In addition to the python scripts, every sub-directory has a written report that explains the physical process being simulated and/or studied as well as a discussion into the computational aspects of it.
